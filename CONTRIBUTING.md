# Issue Guidelines

## Reporting bugs
If you found a bug, report an issue and describe what's the expected behavior versus what actually happens.
If the bug causes a crash, attach a full backtrace. If possible, a reproduction script showing the problem
is highly appreciated.

## Reporting feature requests
Please provide a concise description of the feature and the reasons behind the request.

# Pull Request Guidelines
A Pull Request will only be accepted if it addresses a specific issue that was reported previously, or fixes typos, mistakes in documentation etc.

Other requirements:

1) Do not open a pull request if you can't provide tests along with it. If you have problems writing tests, ask for help in the related issue.
2) Follow the style conventions of the surrounding code. In most cases, this is standard ruby style.
3) Add API documentation if it's a new feature
4) Update API documentation if it changes an existing feature

# Asking for help
If these guidelines aren't helpful, and you're stuck, don't hesitate to open an issue and ask anything.
